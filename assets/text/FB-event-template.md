# Note:

Below is some helpful information for creating Facebook events for the weekly meetups. Everything is current as of October 2019.

The information below is a guideline. Nothing is set in stone and anything can be changed to better suit members' needs.

# Event Name

There are no strict rules about this. To encourage newcomers, it might be a good idea to mention that the event is free, and that it's about learning.

Some past event tiles:

- Learn to Code for Free
- Learn to Code Together
- Learn to Code in Ulsan
- Learn to Code in Samsan-dong
- Learn Coding with Friends
- Learn Coding and Electronics
- Learn to Code and Play with Circuits

# Location

The location should maximize accessibility by public transit, minimize confusion, and ensure a large table with power supply is available and (usually) not fully claimed near the beginning of the meetup.

Please include the address in English, Korean, and at least one link to a popular Korean navigation app.

It seems like Facebook can't find our usual Starbucks, so just use the address to avoid ambiguity:

**Starbucks 310 Dotjil-ro Nam-gu Ulsan**

# Date

Usually every Saturday, but can be changed to suit members' needs.

# Time

Usually 2-5pm but can be changed to suit members' needs. Start and end times are a suggestion only. People can come and go whenever they please. There's also no need to leave at 5pm.

# Description

It's nice to keep count of how many meetups the group's had so far. You'll find a sentence reading: `This is our XXth meetup.` Increment this for every new event so we can get an idea of the group's longevity :)

Tired of the hagwon life? Want to learn a skill that's super in-demand and leads to well-paying jobs with perks, flexible hours, paid relocation, and remote possibilities? Want to have fun learning with others along the way? Join us to get started and meet other people interested in coding.

This is our XXth meetup.

Bring your laptop to the Starbucks located at the address above. We'll be going through the coding lessons at https://freecodecamp.org

Message from the organizer:
I learned to code in my spare time in just a few months using freeCodeCamp's online curriculum, then I worked as a web developer abroad. The experience changed my life and now I want everyone to know how easy it is to get started coding. Before I started learning, I had no idea that you could get job-ready using only free online resources. Coding was never on my radar until a friend told me about freeCodeCamp and dragged me to a meeting. Being around other people on the same learning journey helped a lot.
